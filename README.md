# PATTERN-PRINTING-
This C program prints patterns using loops. It helps understand how nested loops control rows and columns to create different shapes with numbers, stars, or characters.  Working:  Takes number of rows (or uses fixed value).  Uses nested for loops — outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns.
